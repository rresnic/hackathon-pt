# Bookstore

## The book store is a program that was designed to:
### * Manage internal data, find out user preferences about what type of books they buy (whether by author, category)
### * Allows you to check the inventory of books in the store, add new books or increase the stock available.
### * Add new users
### * Make sales

## Comments
### - Due to Google's book API lacking a significant number of ISBN values, you may fail to add some books to the database. This is expected- ISBNs are required data

## Requirements: 
### - git clone https://github.com/rresnic/hackathon-pt.git
### - Python3
### - Virtual environment: python3 -m venv venv
### - Activate with: source venv/bin/activate
### - pip install -r requirements.txt
### - Python3 main.py
